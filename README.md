# NOVA Microhypervisor

This is the source code for the NOVA microhypervisor.

The NOVA microhypervisor combines microkernel and hypervisor functionality
and provides an extremely small trusted computing base for user applications
and virtual machines running on top of it. The microhypervisor implements a
capability-based authorization model and provides basic mechanisms for
virtualization, spatial and temporal separation, scheduling, communication,
and management of platform resources.

NOVA can be used with a multi-server environment that implements additional
operating-system services in user mode, such as device drivers, protocol
stacks, and policies. On machines with hardware virtualization features,
multiple unmodified guest operating systems can run concurrently on top of
the microhypervisor.

**This code is experimental and not feature complete. If it breaks, you get
  to keep both pieces.**

## Building

### Required Tools

The following tools are needed to compile the source code:

- **make 3.81 or higher**, available from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/
- **binutils 2.23 or higher**, available from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/
- **gcc 7.1 or higher**, available from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/

### Build Environment

The build environment can be customized permanently in `Makefile.conf` or
ad hoc by passing the applicable `ARCH`, `BOARD` and `PREFIX_` variables to
the invocation of `make` as described below.

- `PREFIX_aarch64` sets the path for an **ARMv8-A** cross-toolchain
- `PREFIX_x86_64` sets the path for an **x86 (64bit)** cross-toolchain

For example, if the ARMv8-A cross-toolchain is located at
```
/opt/aarch64-linux/bin/aarch64-linux-gcc
/opt/aarch64-linux/bin/aarch64-linux-as
/opt/aarch64-linux/bin/aarch64-linux-ld
```

then set `PREFIX_aarch64=/opt/aarch64-linux/bin/aarch64-linux-`

### Supported Architectures

#### ARMv8-A (64bit)
